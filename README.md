Co-Fence is a service that focuses on improving the management of incident reporting, employee data, and information sharing for construction site workers. Co-Fence is a word that means "fence together" in English.

We have designed Co-Fence to be the simplest configuration among domestic safety reporting systems, maximizing efficiency in real-time communication among employees through an employee database and a phone call button.
